                        Welcome to my talk "How to Develop Orchestration Logic in APIs with Baker".<br>
                        The API part is actually irrelevant. You can use Baker for lots of Orchestration Logic for your processes.<br>

                        Non developers can look at this graph, which is created from the official code and determine if things are not happening in order as they excepted.<br>
